# Welcome to My First Project!

This project introduces you to embedded C/C++ programming, basic digital electronics, and essential GitHub workflow.

# ðŸš¦ Arduino Smart Traffic Light Controller

A beginner Electrical and Electronics Engineering (EEE) project using an Arduino Uno to simulate a basic, intelligent traffic intersection.

## Features

1.  Standard traffic light sequence (Red, Red-Yellow, Green, Yellow).
2.  **Pedestrian Request Feature:** A button allows pedestrians to temporarily interrupt the sequence to request a crossing (all lights go Red).

## Components Used

| Component | Pin Used |
| :--- | :--- |
| Red LED | Digital 13 |
| Yellow LED | Digital 12 |
| Green LED | Digital 11 |
| Pedestrian Button | Digital 2 |

## How to Run

1.  Wire the components according to the circuit diagram.
2.  Open `pending` in the Arduino IDE.
3.  Select the correct board (Arduino Uno) and port.
4.  Upload the code. The sequence will begin automatically. Press the button (Pin 2) to test the pedestrian interrupt!
